# Relative_Clause_Mastery

## Objective:
1. To help learners identify and use basic relative pronouns (who, which, that) in simple sentences.
2. To reinforce understanding of the relationship between the main clause and the relative clause.
3. To develop the ability to use relative clauses to add detail to sentences.

## Lesson Structure
### 1. Introduction (10 Minutes)
 1) Goal: Explain the concept of relative clauses and introduce basic relative pronouns: "who," "which," and "that."
 2) Content:
  - What is a relative clause? A part of a sentence that gives more information about a noun.
  - What are subject and object relative pronouns?
    
    (1) Subject Relative Pronoun (주격 관계대명사): The relative pronoun functions as the subject of the relative clause.
     - Examples: "The boy who lives next door is my best friend." "The boy who is playing soccer is my brother."
     - Explanation: In the relative clause "who lives next door," the pronoun "who" is the subject performing the action (lives).
       
    (2) Object Relative Pronoun (목적격 관계대명사): The relative pronoun functions as the object of the verb in the relative clause.
     - Examples: "The book that I read was fascinating." "The book which I borrowed is on the table."
     - Explanation: In the relative clause "that I read," the pronoun "that" is the object of the action (read).
 
### 2. Drag-and-Drop Activity (5 Minutes)
 (1) Objective: Help learners identify the correct relative pronoun.
 (2) Activity: 
  - Sentences are shown with blanks for relative pronouns.
  - A draggable list of pronouns ("who," "which," "that") is provided.
  - Learners drag the correct pronouns into the blank.
 (3) Examples:
  - "The teacher ___ helped me is very kind." (Answer: who)
  - "This is the movie ___ I watched last night." (Answer: that)
 (4) Feedback: Provide immediate feedback: Correct answers light up; incorrect answers show explanations.

### 3. Fill in the Blank with Relative Clause (10 Minutes)
 (1) Objective: Practice forming relative clauses. 
 (2) Activity: Learners are given a sentence with a blank and need to write the relative clause.
 (3) Examples:
  - Prompt: "Write a sentence about a teacher who inspires you."
  - Input: "The teacher who inspires me teaches English."
  - Prompt: "Describe a book you love using 'which.'"
  - Input: "The book which I love is a mystery novel."
  - Prompt: "Write a sentence about a friend whom you like."
  - Input: 

### 4. Combine Sentences Using Relative Clauses (15 Minutes)
(1) Objective: Develop the ability to combine two sentences into one using relative clauses.
(2) Activity: Learners are given two sentences and need to combine them into one.
(3) Examples:
    Input:
     - Sentence 1: "The man is my neighbor."
     - Sentence 2: "He drives a blue car."
     Output: "The man who drives a blue car is my neighbor."
    Input:
    - Sentence 1: "I love the pizza."
    - Sentence 2: "You made it yesterday."
    - Output: "I love the pizza that you made yesterday."
(4) Feedback:
  - Highlight the relative clause in the output sentence for visual reinforcement.
  - TTS reads the combined sentence aloud for auditory learning.

### 5. Write Your Own Relative Clause (10 Minutes)
  (1) Objective: Practice forming relative clauses from prompts.
  (2) Activity Learners are given a sentence with a prompt and need to write relative clause.
  (3) Examples:
   - Prompt: "Write a sentence about a teacher who inspires you."
   - Input: "The teacher who inspires me teaches English."
   - Prompt: "Describe a book you love using 'which.'"
